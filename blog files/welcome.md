# Welcome to GerBreOwn's Blog about Open Source (FREE) software.

This blog will list FREE Open Source software that I use or have used.  It will also list some cheap software that I use.  It will NOT have the software available here but will have links to where the latest version of the software is available for download.

## If your favorite Open Source software is not listed here it is because:

1.  It is on my list but not added to this blog yet.

2.  I have not used that software.

3.  I have used it and found it is not very useful.

4.  It is designed specifically for Apple computers and I have not used Apple.  If it is included on the author's website then it will be included here.

## To have your favorite added to this blog just leave me a comment on any of the posts.
