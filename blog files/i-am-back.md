I'm back.

I have been off looking at more & new software packages so have not had time to add any new posts to this blog so thought it is now time to start again after installing the new version 14.04 Ubuntu.

Some that I have found and will reporting on in the future are:

    Softcover - An application for writers to self-publish their works of art.
    Geany - A text editor on steroids.
    Django - Framework for developing web sites and PC applications.
    Xsane - An application for scanning documents.
    Sphinx - Another application for creating ebooks.
    Ruby & Rubygems - A programming language and additions for creating websites and PC applications.
    Tricare booklet - A booklet that I created for US military personnel.
    Autojump - An application that is used in a Linux terminal to jump to directories.
    Tellico - An application for cataloging your libraries (books, music, etc. )

I plan to come back to this post when I create the 9 above listed topics and link them to the actual post at that time.
