# Manage your library, whether books, music software or others.

## This is about free library software programs.

### The first is called Tellico.

## Where is this available?

If you are using Ubuntu Linux then it is available in the repository and can be installed by entering "sudo apt-get install tellico".  This will install it to your system and be ready to run. 

However at the time of this writing the current version in the repository is 2.3.8.  Version 2.3.9 is available on the web site but when I tried to install it I got a lot of errors and was not able to install it. Oh well, guess I will just have to wait until Ubuntu gets the new version in their repository.

## What operating systems will it run on?  ONLY ONE, Linux!!!

## Other library managers.

### Another one that I have used is GCStar.

## Where is this available?

## This application will operate on Linux, Mac and Windows.

Both of these applications are very similar in operation.

* Just enter a ISBN, Title or Author and press enter (If using a Bar Code Scanner it will put in the enter for you).
* It will then scan the database that you specify for the information you entered. 
    * There are a number of databases that you can choose from for your search.
    * I found that _tellico_ is faster on finding the data.
* Click the save button all of the information will be saved on your hard drive and it will be waiting for your next inquiry.
