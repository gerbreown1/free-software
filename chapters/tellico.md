# Manage your library.

## This is about a free library software programs.

The first is called Tellico.

## Where is this available?

If you are using Ubuntu Linux then it is available in the repository and can be installed by entering "sudo apt-get install tellico".  This will install it to your system and be ready to run. 

However at the time of this writing the current version in the repository is 2.3.8.  Version 2.3.9 is available on the web site but when I tried to install it I got a lot of errors and was not able to install it. Oh well, guess I will just have to wait until Ubuntu gets the new version in their repository.

## What operating systems will it run on?  ONLY ONE, Linux!!!

## Other library managers.

GCStar.
