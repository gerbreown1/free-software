# Preface

## Notice: This guide is still a work in progress so some of the chapters are **NOT** complete yet.

## History
This all started when I decided to create a blog site about the free software I have used. 

I then read a book called **Blog a Book**. This explained how to turn a blog into an ebook. 

I then discovered an ebook creation system called **Softcover** so I decided to turn those blog posts into an ebook.

## The reason for the blog and book.

I hoped that by publishing this book that you, the reader, can get more use from your computer without spending a lot of hard earned income by purchasing expensive *closed source* software when there is **FREE** *open source* software available.

### Who produces *closed source* software?

* Apple
* Microsoft 

### Who produces *open source* software?

Anyone that wants to!!! 

Generally these are individuals or corporations that want to contribute to the software community.  Sometimes the corporation will charge for support of their product to earn an income.

There are numerous Licenses the software can be copyrighted to that allow for anyone to make changes to the software and distribute under their name.

## This book will include software that can be used on a desktop computer or on the Internet.

It will also indicate what operating system the application is designed for, whether Linux, Mac or Windows.  It will also include the website address where the software can be downloaded. This will allow you to get the latest version of the software.
