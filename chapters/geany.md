# Get the bottle, release and learn what Geany can do for you.
##To get the bottle.

Go to Geany. Once there select the bottle (package) for your system and download.

There are two files that contain the source code (Linux & Mac) and two different files for Windows.
To release Geany.

Just extract the source files to a directory on your system or if using Windows just click on the *.exe file.
Now comes the hard part. Learn what Geany can do for you.

The ONLY reason this the hard part is because there is SO much to learn.
Things to learn:
What is Geany?

This is not the genie from TV or other stories. This is a text editor on steroids, and is what I am using to create this post. It is also being used for the ebooks that I am creating on Softcover.
Files Geany can edit.

    First it can edit text but it can edit it in so many ways for so many applications. I currently using it to create a Markdown file that I will post to my blog site.

    It can edit source code for many 24 different programming languages.
    It can edit source code for 19 different scripting languages.
    It can edit source code for 9 different markup languages such as Markdown, which I am using for this post.
    It can edit source code for 6 other miscellaneous file types.

Encoding formats Geany can use.

    West Europe
    East Europe
    East Asian
    SE & SW Asian
    Middle East
    Unicode
    None

As I have this set to Markdown in the above list I just entered 1. for each item and then it renumbered them. If I was to insert an additional item to the list it would then give it the correct number and renumber the additional items.
Other document functions that Geany can perform.

Line wrapping, line breaking, auto-indentation, indent type, indent width, clone, strip trailing spaces, replace tabs with spaces, replace spaces with tabs, fold all, unfold all (I don’t know what they mean by this, but it must be useful for something), finally it can remove markers and error indicators.
The Geany screen.
The menu line.

This contains the customary menu options found in most other applications, such as file, edit, search, view, document(used for setting the above options), project(for programming projects), build(again for programming projects), tools and help.
The top line.

This contains the usual 3 buttons to close, minimize, and maximize the window. Also is the file name and directory of the file that is being worked on.
The second line.

This line contains icons for various functions. One icon that is missing is for the print function. This can be performed by pressing the Ctrl-P or selecting the option from the file menu.
Below these lines.

On the left side of the screen is a list of documents that have been opened and worked on. On the right of the screen is the main edit screen with line numbers down the left side of this area.
Below the edit window on the list are 6 links that will open other windows depending on the link selected. These are:

    Status — this will show all of the actions performed for the open session.
    Compiler — this is used for compiling programs.
    Messages — I’m not sure what this is used for because on my screen currently it is blank. Possibly output from compiling programs.
    Scribble — here you can make notes to yourself such as, TO-DO lists.
    Terminal — here you can perform actions that you would have to open an other terminal program for.
    Markdown Preview — when using the Markdown format it will show you what the markdown code will look like when processed.

The bottom line.

This will show you the line number, the col number and other information.
Tools menu items.

There are 2 options for using configuration files, choosing colors, word count (I would like it more if this was shown continuously, like in LibreOffice - Writer), plug-in manager(there are a number of plug-ins available for Geany), and finally there is a spell checker(which is one of the plug-ins, as is the Markdown plug-in).

The spell checker has a number of dictionaries that you can use.
