# Get the bottle, open, release and learn what Geany can do for you.
## To get the bottle.

Go to <a href="http://geany.org">Geany</a>. Once there select the bottle (package) for your system and download.

There are two files that contain the source code (Linux &amp; Mac) and two different files for Windows.
## To release Geany.

Just extract the source files to a directory on your system. An even easier way to install it if using Ubuntu Linux it is to enter "sudo apt-get install geany"
## Now comes the hard part. 
Learn what Geany can do for you. The ONLY reason this the hard part is because there is SO much to learn.
## Things to learn:
### What is Geany?

This is not the genie from TV or other stories. This is a text editor on steroids, and is what I am using to create this post. It is also being used for the ebooks that I am creating on Softcover.
### Files Geany can edit.

First it can edit text files but it can edit it in so many ways for so many applications. I am currently using it to create a Markdown file that I will post to my blog site and to create this ebook.

* It can edit source code for many different programming languages.
* It can edit source code for 19 different scripting languages.
* It can edit source code for 9 different markup languages such as Markdown, which I am using for this post.
* It can edit source code for 6 other miscellaneous file types.

### Encoding formats Geany can use.

1. West Europe
1. East Europe
1. East Asian
1. SE &amp; SW Asian
1. Middle East
1. Unicode
1. None

As I have this set to Markdown in the above list I just entered 1. for each item and then it renumbered them. If I was to insert an additional item to the list it would then give it the correct number and renumber the additional items.
### Other document functions that Geany can perform.

Line wrapping, line breaking, auto-indentation, indent type, indent width, clone, strip trailing spaces, replace tabs with spaces, replace spaces with tabs, fold all, unfold all (this is used when writing programming code with multiple functions that you don't need to see at the moment), finally it can remove markers and error indicators.
## The Geany screen.
### The menu line.

This contains the customary menu options found in most other applications, such as file, edit, search, view, document(used for setting the above options), project(for programming projects), build(again for programming projects), tools and help.
The top line.

This contains the usual 3 buttons to close, minimize, and maximize the window. Also is the file name and directory of the file that is being worked on.
The second line.

This line contains icons for various functions. One icon that is missing is for the print function. This can be performed by pressing the Ctrl-P or selecting the option from the file menu.
Below these lines.

On the left side of the screen is a list of documents that have been opened and worked on. On the right of the screen is the main edit screen with line numbers down the left side of this area.
Below the edit window on the list are 6 links that will open other windows depending on the link selected. These are:

+ Status — this will show all of the actions performed for the open session.
+ Compiler — this is used for compiling programs.
+ Messages — I’m not sure what this is used for because on my screen currently it is blank. Possibly output from compiling programs.
+ Scribble — here you can make notes to yourself such as, TO-DO lists.
+ Terminal — here you can perform actions that you would have to open an other terminal program for.
+ Markdown Preview — when using the Markdown format it will show you what the markdown code will look like when processed.

### The bottom line.

This will show you the line number, the column number and other information.
### Tools menu items.

There are 2 options for using configuration files, choosing colors, word count *(I would like it more if this was shown continuously, like in LibreOffice - Writer)*, plug-in manager*(there are a number of plug-ins available for Geany)*, and finally there is a spell checker(which is one of the plug-ins, as is the Markdown plug-in).

The spell checker has a number of dictionaries that you can use.

### While using Geany I stated above that I am using it to create my blog posts as well as using it for this ebook, I used the following commands to copy the text between the two.

All of these commands are executed while pressing the **Ctrl** Key plus a letter key. These commands have been around since the WordStar days. This was one of the first word processing programs to be used on a personal computer.

They are:

+ CTRL + a  Marks ALL of the text in the document where the cursor is.
+ CTRL + b  Makes the marked text **BOLD**. It can be turned on and then whatever is typed will be **BOLD** until it is turned off again. This is a toggle combination and the first time it is turned ON and the next time it is turned OFF.
+ CTRL + c  This copies all marked text to the clipboard.
+ CTRL + s  This saves the current file.
+ CTRL + v  This will paste the clipboard text to the current position of the cursor. 

The sequence that I generally followed to copy the text from the ebook to the blog post was to use CTRL-s to save the text, CTRL-a to mark all of the text, CTRL-c to copy the text. I would then transfer to the blog site and use CTRL-v to paste the text into the blog post that I was working on.
