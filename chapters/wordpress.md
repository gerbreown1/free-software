# Create your own blog site.

## How do I do this?
Wordpress is the software for creating your own personal **blog**.

### Wordpress comes in two versions.
1. From Wordpress.**com**.
1. From Wordpress.**org**.

## Wordpress.com
This website provides you with your own FREE blog. All you have to do is sign up for an account and then you can start creating your blog posts.

## Wordpress.org
To use this version of Wordpress you need to download the software from Wordpress.org and then install it on your webhost's system.

### Some webhosts have what is called a 1-click install for Wordpress as well as for other software applications.

Check with your host to see if they provide this service.
