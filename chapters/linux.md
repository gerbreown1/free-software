# 9 Reasons why YOU should switch to Linux!

## If you have already switched, then congratulations... 
For the rest of you please continue reading to learn why *YOU* should also switch.

1. It is **FREE**. As in legally free or with an Open Source license (of which there are several).
1. It is designed by users, not some corporate committee.
1. It has many different versions for you to choose from.
    1. A recent issue of Linux Format magazine had an article that compared 50 different versions. This was just a small sampling of distributions that are available.
    1. It has many different desktop designs available so you can change it to your liking, not like the single desktop on other systems.
1. Most of the applications that are used with it are also FREE under the Open Source License.
1. It is Open Source code so if you are so inclined, you can make changes to the source code.
1. It is updated every 6 MONTHS, not every 4-6 **YEARS.**
1. If your hard drive has enough free space, it can be installed alongside other operating systems, even more than one distribution of Linux. 
    
    Most current computer systems now have enough hard drive space available.  It can also be installed on older systems that will not/can not run the current bloated versions of Windows.
     
1.    It is virus free as the users can find and fix security issues.

1.    Most distributions have a live version available so you can try it before actually installing it to your hard drive.

There are many more reasons but I promised you 9 so that is what I have included...

## What is Linux and where can you get it? 
There are many versions available as stated in #3 above so I have included the chart below.

 According to [distrowatch.com](distrowatch.com) the following are the top 9 distributions (distros) as of December 17, 2013.

## How do you install your selection?

These can be from the above list or from another source.

When you select a distro that you want to use you would visit the website for your choice. You can then download a copy to your hard drive. This file will have an extension of .ISO. This file will then need to be burned to a CD or DVD disk depending on the size. With this disk in your disk drive, reboot your computer. If it has been set up correctly it will then boot from this disk. Most versions will give you a choice of TRY A LIVE version or install it to your hard drive. If you choose the live version it will boot up but will NOT copy anything to your hard drive. This is so you can see if you like it and if you do then you can install it to your hard drive.

## When should you install it?

There is no time like the present. The sooner you start using it the sooner you will find what you have been missing...

## Personally, I have only used 3 of the versions listed above.

### Linux Mint.
I really liked the look and feel of this distribution.
The one problem I had with this is when I went to compile a program I discovered that it was missing a lot of applications required for compiling programs.

### Ubuntu.
This is the version that I currently use although I still have Mint installed as a dual boot. I have installed the file manager (Nero) and the desktop (Cinnamon) from Mint into my Ubuntu system so I now get the best of both worlds.

### Fedora.
I had problems getting this installed and after I did get it installed I found that I didn't like the look and feel so I deleted it from my system. This is a benefit of using Linux, if you don't like it then just delete it and try another version.

## Have fun with *YOUR VERSION* of Linux. 
And check your wallet for all of the money you are saving instead of sending it off to Apple or M$.

Several days after I posted this, I received the Christmas 2013 issue of Linux Format(LXF) magazine. In it was an article about the 5 best distributions for a new Linux user.

    \hline
\end{tabular}


*I gave SolusOS3 0 stars because the software was NOT available when I checked for it, LXF gave it 3 stars.*

I had a look at at Zorin OS awhile ago and it looked pretty good, however I did not continue using it. I don't remember the reason now but think it looked too simple, but would be good for a newbie.

One reason that there are so many distros available is because of it being distributed as Open Source. This means that anyone can look at the source code and decides they can make the product better so they change the code to meet their requirements.  

There are many charts showing the lineage of a particular distro. An example of this is where Debian begat Ubuntu, which begat Linux Mint as well as other distros. Fedora is another example as it has also begat a number of other distros.
