# LibreOffice.

## LibreOffice consists of the following modules:

### Writer.

This module is for word processing.

### Calc.

This module is a spreadsheet application.

### Base.

This is a database module for creating simple databases.

### Impress.

This is used for creating slide presentations similar to Power Point.

### Math.

This is for creating documents that contain math equations and formulas.  As I am NOT a mathematician I have NOT used this feature yet. 

### Draw.

This is used for creating drawings or presentations.  I also have not used this application yet but think that it is similar to GIMP.
