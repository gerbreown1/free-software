# Do you need to provide training to your students or employees?

## Then Moodle is for you!!!

MOODLE is a **M**odular **O**bject-**O**riented **D**ynamic **L**earning **E**nvironment.
  
What this means is that the program is used by schools, businesses and others that want to provide study courses on-line for their students.

### Where is it available?
It is available for download at [http://download.moodle.org/](http://download.moodle.org/)

### What operating systems can use it?

It is available for Linux, Mac 10X and Windows. 

It requires: 

1. A web server 
1. A database server. 
1. The PHP language. 

Most users will use this program that is running on a public web-server for the Internet or on a company web server for a company Intranet. 

However, it can also be installed on a personal computer system for development and testing providing the previous software is also installed and running.

### How to use it.

An administrator needs to be created for the site during installation of the software. This person will then create other users that can create lessons and examinations.

Students can either self register or if in a company or school they can be enrolled to meet the requirements of the organization.

####I have just started using it so still have a lot to learn about the program.  
It seems to be a very powerful system. The project that I have started is located at [ham-exam.n8wdt.us](ham-exam.n8wdt.us) and is being designed for potential Amateur Radio Operators to obtain their operating license and for existing Amateur Radio Operators to upgrade their license.
