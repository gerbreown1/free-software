# MOODLE is a Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment.  
What this means is that the program is used by schools, businesses and others that want to provide study courses on-line for their students.

It is available for download at MOODLE

It is available for Linux, Mac 10X and Windows. It requires: A web server, a database server and the PHP language. Most will use this program to run on a public web-server. However, it can also be installed on a personal computer system for development and testing providing the previous software is also installed and running.

I have just started using it so have a lot to learn. It seems to be a very powerful system. The project that I have started is located at ham-exam.n8wdt.us and is being designed for potential Amateur Radio Operators and for existing Amateur Radio Operators to upgrade their license.
