I have just started using this software and it looks very quick and easy to use.  I was able to enter all of my accounts in a very short time.  Will have to see how easy it is to create transactions.

I had tried to use GNUCASH but it required double entry for transactions and I couldn't seem to get it to work.  This one so far seems to be much easier.  

Except for something I just discovered, the documentation is written in French...
