This can be either Apache on Linux or Windows or IIS on Windows (provided it is configured for PHP) or whatever web server is available for Apple.  This web server needs to be configured to handle PHP pages.  Because of these requirements it is not recommended for persons that do not have experience/knowledge of setting up a web server.

With this application you can create MySQL databases, add tables to those databases, add/change/delete records to the tables.

Export and import databases or just certain tables.  This is useful for creating backups of your data.  It can also be used to copy data from one system to another.
