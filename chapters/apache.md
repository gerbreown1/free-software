# Apache 

## What is Apache?
Apache is a web server.  This is used to serve web pages. According to Apache.org “World’s most popular Web Server powers nearly 400 million Websites across the globe”

## Where is this available? 
[http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi) gives you a list of mirror sites where you can download this program.  

A easier site to download this application is [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html)  

This site has an application called XAMPP that will install Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin.  This makes it easy to install these applications.

## What operating system is this used on? 
Linux, Mac or Windows. 

Installing it from the Apache mirrors is NOT for the faint of heart as they provide you with the source code that needs to be compiled before you can use it.  

If you are interested in trying it on your local system, I recommend the XAMPP application.

## Why would you need this program?
You would only need this program if you are planning on running your own web hosting system or if you just want to run a web server on your home system web development work.
