 

This blog does NOT have any software for download, instead it will provide you with the links to where the software is available.  This way you will be able to get the latest version directly from the publisher.

If you find any links that do not take you to the OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE or give you a "404 Page Not Found" error please leave a comment and I will fix the problem as soon as possible.

This blog site will provide you with a list of available OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE for Linux and Windows mainly.  If the author supplies an Apple version, that will be included too.

What this site will NOT provide:

1.  Commercial software that you can buy for a $1.00/disk at a flea-market or ham-fest that includes a crack/serial number.

2.  Commercial software that you can download that includes a crack/serial number.

3.  Commercial software given to you by a friend that includes a crack/serial number.

The reason for the above 3 items is that this type of software is PIRATED SOFTWARE and is not true OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.

What this site WILL provide is blog posts about the OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE that I know about and where you can legally download it.

WHAT IS OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE?

The individual or corporation that has developed the software has made it available for FREE.  It will also include the source code that you can modify and distribute.

The Open Source Initiative has a definition of what Open Source is at this link.  Open Source licenses and other information about Open Source can be found at this link.
