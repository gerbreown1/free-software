# Do you need to transfer files from one computer to another?

## One such application that can do this is Filezilla.
 
You can transfer files from one computer to another.  For example from your home system to a web host computer.

## What operating systems can use it?  
Linux, Mac and Windows.

## Where to get it: 
[http://filezilla-project.org/download.php](http://filezilla-project.org/download.php)

It can be used as a client or a server.  As a client you can connect to other computers.  As a server other computers can connect to your system.  I have only used the client version so don't know anything about the server version, but seeing how easy it is to use the client version the server version should also be very easy.
